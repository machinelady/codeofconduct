####Code for Ireland's Code of Conduct

-- insert opening paragraph here

1. Be respectful. 
2. Be welcoming. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions. Help provide a welcoming environment for people of all backgrounds and identities, and find ways for everyone to be productive with their skills, whether they are technical or nontechnical. Use language such as "yes/and", not "no/but". We want to make sure the entire community is well-represented in the planning, design and implementation of civic tech, so encourage participation from women, minorities and traditionally marginalised groups. Make sure to give people from marginalised groups a voice in discussions, especially if an issue being discussed mainly concerns their own group. Listen at least as much as you speak.
3. Be considerate.  Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
4. Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
 - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
 - Discriminatory jokes and language.
 - Posting sexually explicit or violent material, or using such material in Code for Ireland events.
 - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
 - Unwelcome sexual attention.
 - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
5. When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Code for Ireland is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
6. Focus on building tools for the community. At Code for Ireland, our goal is to create tools that are open and free technology for public use, and we prioritise activities that are for public use as opposed to private gain. We strive to maintain a respectful, participatory and productive relationship between community members, the local government staff and community partners. When making decisions about the tools we build, community groups and experts in the subject matter should be actively involved in the decision making process so we can be sure to create tools that actually suit the community's needs.

Code for Ireland reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Code for Ireland network activities, events, and digital forums.

####Code for Ireland's Anti-Harassment Policy

* * * 

All Code for Ireland network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.

In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Code for Ireland will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1Zg2FDt7awgfCmdcbzMwKHMb1A7KDOhs_z7ibCb3TLLQ/edit">see this guide</a>.

Code for Ireland is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Code for Ireland event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may expelled from Code for Ireland network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organiser or forum administrator.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Code for Ireland network activities, events, and digital forums. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff or forum administrator immediately. You can contact them at [EVENT ORGANIZER/FORUM ADMINISTRATOR EMAIL AND PHONE NUMBER]. Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

If you cannot reach an event organiser or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 112 or 999 and/or remove yourself from the situation. 

You can also contact Code for Ireland about harassment at [EMAIL ADDRESS FOR REPORTING INCIDENTS] and feel free to use the email template below. Code for Ireland staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.

We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.

####Credits

This anti-harassment policy is based on <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">the example policy</a> from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

This policy is based on several other policies, including the Django code of conduct, the Code for America code of conduct, the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.
